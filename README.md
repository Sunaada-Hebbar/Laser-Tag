Designed a prototype of an ‘ArduinoNano’ microcontroller-based system integrated with sensors & actuators (IR emitters, receivers, vibration motors, LEDs & lasers) embedded into a specially tailored jacket and a toy gun. The microcontroller was programmed to emit encrypted unique codes for each player, decrypt & detect hits by other players to temporarily deactivate the suit. The points for each player were calculated in real-time by the embedded software sent to the central microcontroller by RF-Transceiver modules to compute team points. This game was organized as a part of college annual fest "Jayciyana 2016". The hardware\software for the laser tag equipment was designed & prototyped by 2 engineering students. Also, a  team of 15-20 volunteers was mentored to replicate the prototypes into actual equipment for the event.
