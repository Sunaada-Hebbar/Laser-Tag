# Laser-Tag
A   simple   team   based   outdoor   Tagging   game.   Microcontroller   based   system   with   various   sensors/transducers   was   embedded   into   a   Jacket   to   which   a   laser   guided   IR   gun   was   wired.   The   software   was   developed   in   such   a   way   that   each   gun   sends   a   unique   coded   signal   and   each   jacket   was   capable   of   uniquely   identifying   them.   The   points   of   each   player   was   recorded   by   the   embedded   software   and   final   team   score   was   calculated   by   transmitting   each   player's   score   through   RF   transreceivers   to   a   single   computer.   The   game   was   organized   as   a   part   of   college   annual   fest   "Jayciyana   2016".   (Link: ​ https://www.facebook.com/events/1582728592055198/?active_tab=about​ )
