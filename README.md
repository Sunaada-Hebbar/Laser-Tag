Laser Tag Equipment: Laser tag is a team-based outdoor tagging game. Arduino Nano microcontroller based system with various sensors\actuators embedded into a jacket specially tailored for laser tag was designed. A modified toy gun with the capability to send encoded IR bursts was wired to the suit. The gun attached to every suit was able to send unique IR bits for identification and continuously received IR bits from other guns from various sensors on the suit & identified the attacking player. The LEDs and vibration motors on the suit were used to indicate hits & life of the player. The embedded software on each suit computed the number of hits and points. Finally, at the end of the game, the info form each suit was transferred to a single microcontroller using RF trans-receivers and the winning team was declared. This game was organized as a part of college annual fest "Jayciyana 2016". The hardware\software for the laser tag equipment was designed & prototyped by 2 engineering students. Also, a  team of 15-20 volunteers was mentored to replicate the prototypes into actual equipment for the event.
